#Super tic-tac-toe

####What is STTT
Super tic-tac-toe is played like Nine board tic-tac-toe except that the game does not end when a player wins a game on one of the small boards. Instead, the position of the small board where that player won is marked on a 3Ã—3 grid, and a player wins when they form 3-in-a-row on that grid
